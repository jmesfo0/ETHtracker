To Invite the bot to your server, use the [Discord invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=986475568386154527&permissions=2048&scope=bot).

## Self Hosting
 If you would like to host the bot yourself, first set up a Discord bot through the Discord Developer portal. Next, pull this repository onto your local machine:<br />
 `git clone <git_url>`
 <br>
 Open the .env file, and input your BOT_TOKEN in the correct space.
 <br />
 Next, ensure that you have NodeJS and NPM installed and run:
 <br />
 `npm install`
 <br />
 `node .`
 <br />
 Congratulations! You now have a running the Discord bot.
